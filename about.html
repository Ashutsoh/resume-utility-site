<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
Resume Word Counter is a free online utility platform designed to help job seekers, professionals, and students optimize their resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
</p>

<p>
Many resumes get rejected due to improper length, formatting issues, or missing best practices. Our goal is to provide fast, simple, and privacy-friendly tools that help users check resume word count, character length, and ATS-friendly limits instantly.
</p>

<p>
We focus on lightweight tools that work directly in the browser without requiring sign-ups or storing personal data. Our utilities are ideal for resumes, LinkedIn posts, and professional documents.
</p>

<p>
Our mission is to make resume optimization accessible, transparent, and easy for everyone.
